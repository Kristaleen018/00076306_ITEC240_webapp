			<p> The natural beauty of Tobago is amazing. From the green rainforests to the white beaches and colourful coral reefs, all the aspects of this island are a treat to the eyes. It seems unspoiled and real as compared to other developed Caribbean islands.</p>

			<h3>@travelWLia</h3>
			<p> The kindness and generosity of Tobagonian people made our trip simply perfect. In particular, we enjoyed sampling the local cuisine, such as seafood, curried crab with dumplings and other stuff. The images of the food looked amazing and in reality it was delicious.</p>

			<p>The website was very helpful in showcasing its purpose, the sites and the food to expect when visiting Tobago. To register and login was easy and simple. But I wish it showcased some sporting and events to be better prepared.</p>

			<h3>@Amber</h3>
			<p>I found recommendations for local eateries of use in particular. It is so good to see a site which gets away from the usual tourist pitfalls and reflects real Tobagonian flavors. The site even helped me develop a ‘must-eat’ list even before I could set foot on the island!</p>
